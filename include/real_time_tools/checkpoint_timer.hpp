/**
 * @brief Timer to measure code execution time with "checkpoints"
 *
 * This timer is meant to be used for measuring execution time of a loop.  It
 * measures time between calls of the `start` method, so by calling this at the
 * beginning of the loop, you get the execution time of the full iteration.
 * Further, you can define "checkpoints" within the loop to measure time of
 * separate steps in the loop.  Call the `checkpoint` method after the code that
 * is associated with it.  For each checkpoint, the time elapsed since the last
 * checkpoint is measured (`start` counts as a checkpoint in this regard).
 *
 * Example:
 * @snippet demo_checkpoint_timer.cpp Usage of CheckpointTimer
 *
 * @tparam NUM_CHECKPOINTS Number of checkpoints.
 * @tparam ENABLED Set to false, to disable timer.  Method calls will have no
 * effect (and should hopefully be optimized away by the compiler).
