## What is it

This package is a wrapper around different linux OS. It provide APIs over
real time OSs such as Xenomai (not fully operational) and RT-PREEMPT. It also
allows you to get the same fonctionnality (at the cost of real time) with non-real
time OSs such as Ubuntu and MacOs (not fully fonctionnal).
